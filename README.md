# Data Engineering Projects

A collection of real-world Data Engineering projects showcasing ETL pipelines, cloud integrations, data processing frameworks, and orchestration tools.

---


## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This repository contains multiple real-world Data Engineering projects designed to showcase my practical skills across ETL pipelines, data orchestration, distributed processing, cloud storage, and SQL data transformations.

Each folder contains independent mini-projects focusing on different areas of Data Engineering:

- **ETL Pipelines:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data using Python and Pandas.
- **Airflow DAGs:** Automating daily, weekly, and monthly data pipelines.
- **Spark Jobs:** Distributed processing of large datasets using PySpark.
- **AWS Integrations:** Interacting with AWS S3, Lambda, and Redshift for cloud-native pipelines.
- **SQL Queries:** Writing and optimizing complex SQL queries for reporting and data transformations.
- **Dockerization:** Packaging pipelines inside Docker containers for reproducible deployment.

The projects are designed to mimic real-world data engineering tasks and workflows used in industry.

> This repository will be continuously updated as I explore more advanced topics, cloud architectures, and large-scale data processing systems.
